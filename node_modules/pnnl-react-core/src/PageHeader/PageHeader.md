A PageHeader is designed to quickly identify the page the user is looking at and provide important high-level information at a glance. An example would be in a request view: in the PageHeader you might find the title of the request, the status as a `Progress` component, and the person who submitted the request as an `AvatarInfo` component. Some of that information might be also visible/editable in the form below the PageHeader, but putting it at the top of the page makes it easy for the user to find and get a high-level understanding of state before diving into details.

The only required element in a PageHeader is a title of some kind.  That could be a read-only `<h1>`, or an editable title in a `FormControl`. The rest is up to what the users need.

You can decide if you want the PageHeader to remain fixed at the top of the page, or to scroll with the rest of the content.  The default is to scroll.

``` js
    <PageHeader className="platinum-30" fluid>
      <Row>
        <Col sm={6}>
          <FormGroup controlId="formLargeText" className="PnnlPageTitle">
            <FormControl bsSize="lg" placeholder="Enter text" value="Page Title" aria-label="Page Title" />
          </FormGroup>
        </Col>
        <Col sm={4}>
          <Progress activeStep={1}>
            <ProgressStep key="1" label="Testing 1" />
            <ProgressStep key="2" label="Testing 2" />
            <ProgressStep key="3" label="Testing 3" />
            <ProgressStep key="4" label="Testing 4" />
          </Progress>
        </Col>
        <Col sm={2}>
          <AvatarInfo title="Geoff Elliott" subTitle="Submitted By" align="center" size="sm" />
        </Col>
      </Row>
    </PageHeader>
