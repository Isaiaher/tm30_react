``` js noeditor
    <Loader size="4" />
```

When things can't be available to the user immediately, the important thing is to make it clear what's happening. If loading content is taking a noticeable amount of time, use a loading indicator to assure the user that the application is still working.

The Loader component is a simple presentation component that you can use to show either an unspecified wait, or progress against a determined goal. It can indicate the app is loading, new content is downloading, a form is submitting, or just waiting for response from a server.

We've swiped our Loader from Google's Material Design components. In their documentation there's [good info about when/how to use a progress indicator](https://material.io/design/components/progress-indicators.html) which we won't bother to copy/paste here.
