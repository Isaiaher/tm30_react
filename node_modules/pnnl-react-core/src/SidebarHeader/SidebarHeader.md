A SidebarHeader is a way of labeling a set of SidebarItems, filters, or other elements within a `Sidebar`, and exposing actions for the user to apply to the entire set.

SidebarHeaders can be built manually and inserted in a `Sidebar`, but more often you'll build one as part of a `SidebarPanel`.

Any actions you want to expose to the user should be passed in as children. They'll automatically be positioned on the right side of the header.

``` js
<Sidebar>
    <SidebarHeader validationState="success" title="Heading">
        <Action icon="refresh" />
    </SidebarHeader>
</Sidebar>
