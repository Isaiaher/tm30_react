The Header component is of limited use.  You only need one per application, and it will probably be included as part of your main container.

The purpose of the Header is to inform the user of the name of the site/app, contain the Primary Navigation and make it easy to expose the navigation responsively. Most of the design details of how the header should work are contained in the [Site Header](/#/Template/Site%20Header) page of the Template section. This page will only talk about how the component works.

The navigation is built as a separate component and passed in as a prop (this allows us to tweak the behavior of the components independently and without necessarily requiring a rewrite). There's no requirement to have a NavBar as part of your Header, but your site/app will be limited without one.

You can pass in a className to modify the color of the Header, but otherwise changing the presentation/behavior of the header is not allowed.

Clicking on the title of the app/site within the Header will navigate the user to the app/site homepage on a desktop browser.

### Responsive Design
The Header will automatically configure the app/site title as a navigation toggle when viewed with a mobile browser. Tapping the Header will reveal the Primary Navigation; tapping again will hide it.  You don't need to do anything other than specify the navigation just like in the examples; the components will handle the rest.


```js
    const navigation = (
        <NavBar>
            <Col sm={6} componentClass="ul">
                <NavItem to="/" icon="home" text="Home" />
            </Col>
            <Col sm={6} componentClass="ul">
                <NavItem to="/help" icon="help" text="Help" />
            </Col>
        </NavBar>
    );
    <Header
        appTitle="Connected"
        primaryNav={navigation}
        className="mercury"
        fluid
    />
```
