In most cases that we display a person within our interfaces, the user may immediately want to get in contact with that person.  To avoid sending the user to Skype, Outlook, or some other application to look up their contact information, we've implemented an extension to the popover component that puts the contact information at the user's fingertips with just a click.

By default, the Profile Card Popover displays a person's avatar, Skype status, title, and a variety of contact options.  Also included are links to the person's profile and organization page in Hub, and a map to their office in the Map Information Tool. 

The person's organization color is used as a decorative band across the top of the card.

To close the popover the user can click the "X" in the top corner of the card, or click anywhere else in the body of the site/application.
