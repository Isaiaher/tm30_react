NavMenus give us a simple way to add a menu of related items to the primary navigation of an application. Use a NavMenu when the number of items in the NavBar is getting too complicated, or when there's an obvious grouping of items related to a certain topic. Reports are a common example; some applications also provide Help items under a menu.

A NavMenu doesn't work the same as a NavItem: there's no default action on click, the user needs to select an item from the menu.

Props passed to NavMenu are pretty much the same as a NavItem, with the addition of an id (that's needed to properly associate the menu with the trigger button). You'll also pass in children used to create the menu. In most cases that's an array of LinkContainer components (from react-router-bootstrap) with MenuItem components (from react-bootstrap). The LinkContainer handles the routing, and the MenuItem will handle styling within the dropdown menu.

### Responsive Design

There's nothing you need to do to make this work nicely on a mobile device.  The default responsiveness will adapt the primary navigation into an accordion if there are any NavMenu components as part of the NavBar.
