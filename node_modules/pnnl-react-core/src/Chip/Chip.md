The <code>Chip</code> component can be used to represent a person, a place, a tag or other attribute of a thing. Often chips are used to represent a bunch of people, or filters for search results.  

Chips are capable of having onClick handlers attached to them, but should not be used as a button replacement for submitting a form, adding new elements, etc., nor should they navigate the user to a different view. Clicking on a Chip should result in more information about the content the Chip represents (such as a popover for a person/place), or toggling an active/inactive state for the Chip.

Our Chip is composed of three elements: a required text label, an optional thumbnail (like an <code>Avatar</code> or <code>Icon</code>) on the left, and an optional delete button.

When passing an Avatar as a thumbnail, use the 'xs' Avatar size for small and medium Chips, 'sm' for large Chips. An image-based Avatar will always be sized appropriately for the Chip, regardless of what size is specified. When passing a custom element as a thumbnail, make sure it's sized appropriately for the size of Chip being used (see the props info). Examples are available in the Chip section of the pnnl-react-core Storybook.

It probably goes without saying, but if a user is allowed to add Chips to an interface, they should also be allowed to delete them. There should never be a time that a user has permissions to add items, but not remove the same items.

The 'xs' size Chip should never have a click handler, a delete handler, or a thumbnail. It's only for highlighting some textual information that needs to fit in a very small area, like when passed as a prop to an <code>AvatarInfo</code> component.
