Tabs can be used in a couple of different ways.  They can either be a simple inline way to expose different sections of a page, or they can be an alternative to `Sidebar` navigation. You should never use both `Sidebar` and `Tab` navigation in the same page.

Our Tab component is not very different from the way that react-bootstrap's `NavItem` components works (and, in fact, Tab uses NavItem in its render() method). The added wrinkle is a `validationState` prop that will display a `ValidationIcon` component. This allows you to give the user a little more info about where they might need to make changes before they can submit a form, avoiding the need to hunt around.

``` js
<Nav bsStyle="tabs" activeKey="1">
    <Tab to="/details" validationState="error" active>Details</Tab>
    <Tab to="/hazards">Hazards</Tab>
    <Tab to="/controls">Controls</Tab>
</Nav>
```
