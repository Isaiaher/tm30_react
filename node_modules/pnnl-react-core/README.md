## Local Setup

Yarn is our package manager of choice here. Check out setup
instructions [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) if you don't have it installed already.
After that you can run `yarn install` to install all the needed dependencies.

From there you can:

- Run the tests once with `yarn test`.
- Start a local copy of the Storybook site with `yarn run storybook`
- Or build a local copy of the library with `yarn run build`

These commands also work with `npm` but your mileage may vary.
