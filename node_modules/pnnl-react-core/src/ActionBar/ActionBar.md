While the Primary Navigation sits at the top and allows the user to move through a site/application, at the bottom of an application can sit another collection of actions in what we call an "Action Bar".  

```js noeditor
    <ActionBar fluid>
        <Col sm={4}>
            <Action to="/submit" icon="share" text="Submit" />
        </Col>
        <Col sm={4}>
            <Action to="/details" icon="info" text="Details" />
        </Col>
        <Col sm={4}>
            <Action to="/delete" icon="trash" text="Delete" />
        </Col>
    </ActionBar>
```

The actions in an Action Bar, though they appear similar in structure and presentation to the Primary Navigation at the top of the application, should not be used for navigation. And unlike the Primary Navigation actions, these absolutely should be dependent upon the current context of the application.

Some examples:

* In the **Time Billing** application, the action bar presents actions related to the current time form. Actions like certifying, looking at the edit history of the form, or exporting the current data into a spreadsheet. Even the "next" and "previous" buttons need to act within the context of the current form.
* In the **Assets** application, the actions have two different forms of context. The available actions differ depending upon which asset type is selected, and when executing an action some of the fields can be pre-filled based upon selections the user has made within the application before invoking the action.

The Action Bar can change contents, and even hide/show itself based on the context of the application. Not every view within an application has need for a separate set of actions. Many actions even make more sense inline next to the content they operate on. The appearance, or lack thereof, of the Action Bar can be a hint to the user as to what they can accomplish within a view.

Icons for the Actions within the Action Bar don't change from outline to solid states, because they never have an "active" state like items in the Primary Navigation.  Whatever icon is selected for an Action should be consistent throughout the application, regardless of state.

### Responsive Design
When on a small screen, the Action Bar doesn't collapse like the primary navigation. Instead, it shrinks to a smaller size, and actions are just large enough to be comfortably tapped with a finger. 

Because of the smaller size you may find the actions not all fitting comfortably. You'll need to make the decision for your users as to whether it would be more appropriate to hide some of the actions, or to separate the controls into multiple rows. Bear in mind that the action bar is always fixed to the bottom of the screen, and the more space it takes up the less is available for the main content of the application.

```js
    <ActionBar fluid>
        <Col sm={4}>
            <Action to="/submit" icon="share" text="Submit" />
        </Col>
        <Col sm={4}>
            <Action to="/details" icon="info" text="Details" />
        </Col>
        <Col sm={4}>
            <Action to="/delete" icon="trash" text="Delete" />
        </Col>
    </ActionBar>
```
