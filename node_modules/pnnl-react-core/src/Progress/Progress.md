An alternative view of a timeline is a status progression.  Whereas a timeline lists events that have occurred, in reverse-chronological order, a status progression will list events that have and have yet to occur, in chronological order, giving the user a view into the status of a process, and the future steps needed to complete the process.

The line that connects nodes on a status progression timeline is solid up until the first node that is anything other than Complete. After that the line is dashed, representing an incomplete progression.  

There are 5 possible states for status progression timeline nodes:

``` js noeditor
    <Progress activeStep={1}>
        <ProgressStep status="complete" />
        <ProgressStep status="active" />
        <ProgressStep status="warning" />
        <ProgressStep status="error" />
        <ProgressStep />
    </Progress>
```

* **Complete** – Appears as a 100% emerald circle, no border, and a white icon. The icon used in the node should be in solid form if one is available.
* **Active** – Appears as a 10% gold tint circle, with a 100% gold border and 100% gold icon. The icon used in the node should be in outline form if one is available.
* **Warning** – Appears as a white circle, with a 100% ruby border and 100% ruby icon.  The icon used in the node should be in outline form if one is available.
* **Error** – Appears as a 100% ruby circle, no border, with a solid white error icon.
* **Inactive** – Appears as a white circle with a 100% platinum border and 100% platinum icon. The icon used in the node should be in outline form if one is available.

By default, all nodes will have a checkmark icon unless otherwise specified when instantiating the component. Error nodes should have an error or crossmark icon.

Event details with a horizontal status progression should always be exposed through a modal, popover, or tab details kind of interface.  Only the node label should be visible by default.
