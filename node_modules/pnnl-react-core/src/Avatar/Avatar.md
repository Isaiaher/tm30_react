An Avatar is our way of visually denoting a person, place, or thing in a simple way.  It takes the form of a circle with a picture, icon, or text, using colors to convey additional information. A simple example is the staff profile picture that you see all around our applications.

You'll regularly see Avatars indicating a space using an image from the Map Information Tool; an organization using the org icon and colored with the organization color; and a person that doesn't have a profile picture and instead has the first letters of their first/last names as an abbreviation.

Avatars should never be used by themselves as an interactive point, except to link to more information about the item they represent (for example, a profile card for a person whose picture is in the Avatar). Don't use an Avatar with an icon in place of an Action or Button.
