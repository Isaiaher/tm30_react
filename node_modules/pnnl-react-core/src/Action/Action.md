```js noeditor
<div>
    <Action text="Info" icon="info" />
    <Action text="Add Item" icon="plus-circle" displayType="additive" />
    <Action text="Favorite" icon="star" displayType="favorite" />
    <Action text="Delete" icon="trash" displayType="danger" />
</div>

An Action is pretty much what it sounds like. It's a button or link that when clicked on will do something. That could be navigating, launching a dialog, submitting a form, opening a menu, or any number of things that our applications do. These actions make up the primary building blocks of the Primary Navigation bar, Action Bar, and Action Lists.

There are two parts of an Action: an icon, and a short descriptive label. In most circumstances, these are both shown together, stacked vertically, with the icon being more prominent. Sometimes when space is constrained the label will be hidden, or displayed as a tooltip. Other times, such as with the Primary Navigation on smaller screens, the icon and label will be positioned side-by-side.

The hover state (on systems that support such a thing) can vary depending upon what widget the Action is in. But in general, the entire block of the Action gets a color highlight, not just the icon or label. And the label should never be underlined on hover. Background and text color changes are the way we indicate interaction with Actions.

The label associated with each Action should be short (to fit within the allotted space) and should be a verb that clearly indicates to the user what the result of clicking on the Action will be.

<Action text="Add Item" icon="plus-circle" displayType="additive" />
