The ProfileCard is the same information that's presented in the ProfilePopover (it uses the same component).  But having that data in a separate component gives us flexibility: we can display a person's contact information outside of a popover, directly within the UI, or use the same layout with customized data to handle non-PNNL staff.

If you don't supply information like phone numbers, email address, location, etc., the ProfileCard will just ignore that section and move on to the next.

};
<div style={{ width: 200 }}>
