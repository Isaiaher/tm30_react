There are three required pieces of a timeline item: 

* An `Avatar` which will anchor the item on the timeline. The Avatar will usually be an icon that will help the user quickly identify the nature of the event. Choose familiar common icons like `checkmark` for approvals, `crossmark` for denials, `attach` for attachments, etc. You can also change the background color of the avatar to make identifying the type of event even easier (see our [color guidelines](http://forge.pnl.gov/standards/#/Style/Color) for more info)
* A short title describing the event.  This should be simple enough to fit on one line, something like "New Attachment", "User Removed", "Request Approved", etc.
* The date (and optionally the time) the event occurred.

Beyond that, you're encouraged to add details about the event that users will find useful and informative. For the title examples above the details could be: the filename, file type, and link to the attachment; the name and profile picture of the user who was removed, maybe with an undo button; the name and profile picture of the person who approved the request, and the title of the role they were operating as.

Try not to include too much information. If the TimelineItem starts to get long, consider adding a link to open more information in a modal dialog or a separate page.

``` js
    <TimelineItem>
        <h3>Event Title</h3>
        <div className="timestamp">Sep. 1, 4:10 PM</div>
        <p>Another thing happened.</p>
    </TimelineItem>
```
