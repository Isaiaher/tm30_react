Cards have become a popular design pattern in recent years.  They are now so popular that we need to be careful not to overuse them in order to protect the impact they can have on user focus and understanding.

In our PNNL house style a card often represents a Thing.  It might be a Travel request, publication, calendar event, facility, or conference Room. We use the card to associate supplemental information and interaction points with that Thing, and separate them from the rest of the items on a page.

When is a good time to use a card? When you have similar items with similar functionality tied to each individual item, cards can help the user distinguish each item. When you have items that the user will be sorting/moving using drag-and-drop, cards can serve as an affordance to help the user understand what the interface wants them to do.

When should you NOT use a card? Cards shouldn't be used as a box or other visual separator for normal content.  A card shouldn't act as a navigation menu.  Cards should never appear within other cards. Be careful that multiple cards in a single interface all represent items that are similar in some way.  If the items aren't related somehow, a card doesn't make sense.

Some examples of cards in our applications:

* Assets can be displayed in a card.  This features a big photo of the asset to help the user quickly pick out the asset they want to work with. They can select the asset as part of a collection or open a link to the asset details.
* Conference rooms found through Scout's conference room search are each displayed in a card that shows times the room is available.
* Insight collects its charts and tables into cards that can be repositioned on each dashboard.

Card design should remain consistent across applications.  It will help a user quickly identify what they're seeing.
