Identifying people within our sites and applications is a common task. Users need to know who is responsible for or associated with an item, and they need to be able to identify and distinguish individual people amongst lists of them.  To help we've come up with a pattern of identifying people and their roles, and supplying contact information with a single click.

The Person component combines a staff member's avatar (the picture used in Skype and Outlook) and Skype status aligned next to their name and title. In the case that the user hasn't customized their avatar, a default image is supplied for them.

<!-- Mimicking the presentation in Skype and Outlook, a user's Skype status is displayed as a colored, circular icon in the bottom right corner of their avatar. The four possible statuses are Away, Busy, Available, Offline. Each combine both color and shape so that color-blind users will still be able to distinguish between the various statuses. -->

By default, the Person component should use a person's name, FirstName LastName, as the larger text, with their official title or role as the smaller text underneath.  In some cases, it makes more sense to identify the role first, and have the person's name be the subtitle.

Whenever you need to represent a PNNL staff member, use a variant of the Person component. It's built on top of the `AvatarInfo` component, and allows you to pass through the same `align` and `size` props. You could certainly use `AvatarInfo` by itself, but Person can save you a bit of time by pulling the correct info from our standard Ops Warehouse data object.
