``` js noeditor
<div style={{fontSize: '3em'}}>
    <ValidationIcon validationState="success" />
    <ValidationIcon validationState="warning" />
    <ValidationIcon validationState="error" />
    <ValidationIcon validationState="incomplete" />
</div>
```

ValidationIcon is a simple wrapper that translates a `validationState` prop into one of our `Icon` components. This is mostly used by other components that need to visually display the validation state, such as `SidebarItem`, `SidebarHeader`, and `Tab`.

``` js
<ValidationIcon validationState="success" />
```
