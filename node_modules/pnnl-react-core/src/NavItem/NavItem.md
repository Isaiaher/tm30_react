NavItems are the basis for navigation in applications.  It always consists of an Icon and a label, and a route for the app to navigate to when the NavItem is clicked. 

NavItems can have a badge displaying a count.  This count should represent the number of something the user needs to take care of and will find if they visit the page linked to by the NavItem. It's important that the count represent items requiring action; the presence of a count badge should be rare, to draw the user's attention, and the user should be able to make this count go away by performing actions within the application.

### Responsive Design

On mobile devices the NavItems are rearranged into a vertical list, with the icon and label side by side and any count floated to the right of the NavItem. Tapping on the NavItem will still navigate the user to the specified route.
