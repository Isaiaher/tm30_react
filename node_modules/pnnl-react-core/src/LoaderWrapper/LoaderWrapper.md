The LoaderWrapper is a very simple component that will hide the `children` and instead display a Loader and message when you pass a `show` prop. This makes it very easy to show/hide content based on responses from the server.

``` js
    <LoaderWrapper message="Wait for it..." show>
        Loading test
    </LoaderWrapper>
```
