Often times we want to display a chronological list of events, with added info for each, and provide some interaction options for each event. Historical context for the information we work with every day can be important, so to make sure that users always immediately understand what they’re looking at we’ve defined a standard timeline widget.

Timelines in sidebars should be displayed by default in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent event first, and the oldest last. Users can choose to re-sort or filter the contents of a timeline if you provide a filter/sort mechanism for them to interact with.  A common pattern we use is a single select control in the header of the sidebar.

Timelines work great for simple chronological lists, though not so well for situations like a comments thread with nested responses. The timeline is single track. Bear that in mind when deciding if you want to use it.

Each event in the timeline has a couple key components: a node, and the event details. The node is a circle with an icon.  The color of the circle should match the type of event that is being presented, same with the icon. Each node is connected by a thin line (it’s a timeline, right?).

Event details should be kept brief.  If you need to expose a lot of data to the user, link to it.

## Responsive Design
Not much needs to change about how timelines are displayed on mobile devices; a vertical timeline will be easy to scroll through on a phone. But depending upon the nature of the application, a timeline in a sidebar should probably be toggled on/off through a button or other link to save valuable screen real estate.
