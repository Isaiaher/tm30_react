The AvatarInfo component is a concise way to display information about an Avatar (yes, it's a very creative name).

This is a pure display component, taking the properties that you supply and slotting them into the right spots.  There's no logic for retrieving information, though AvatarInfo will construct a default Avatar for you based on the Title if you don't supply an avatarComponent prop.

AvatarInfo is used by other components as content for a button or a search results list. You might be better off using some of those related components instead of this.  But AvatarInfo is here if you need a no-frills way to display content in this way, within a page or within your own custom component.

You can pass components instead of, or in addition to, strings for the title and subTitle props, but it's important to use this appropriately. 

* Make sure that components being passed as props don't disrupt the layout of the AvatarInfo. <code>Icon</code>s should take their size from the accompanying text, <code>Chip</code>s should use the 'xs' size, etc.
* Components passed as props should be presentational, not interactive. Any interaction needs to take place in whatever component contains the AvatarInfo.

If you're passing a component with text or a group of components as a prop to AvatarInfo, you'll need to either wrap them in a ```<span>``` or group them in an array. Passing content as an object or within a React Fragment won't work.

const goodHeader = (
    <div>
        <strong>Do</strong>
        <p>Use small, static components that provide information and don't break the presentation.</p>
    </div>
);

const badHeader = (
    <div>
        <strong>Don't</strong>
        <p>Add large components that break the presentation or that add interaction.</p>
    </div>
);

function clickHandler() {
    alert("Don't do this!");
}
