Our Sidebar component has a specific function. While it's easy to use the Bootstrap grid to align items and create sidebars, the Sidebar component is intended to be a separate part of the page that either exposes supplemental information (like a timeline) or acts as navigation to other related pieces of content outside of the current page.

Sidebars should never be used as the primary navigation for an application or website.

Like an `ActionBar`, sidebars can come and go as the user navigates to different parts of an application/website. They don’t need to be a constant element of the design like the `Header` or `Navbar`.

Sidebars can be collapsible, allowing the user to decide when to show the content or when to focus their attention on other parts of the interface. You should consider whether you can make the sidebar responsive to the screen size, showing it by default at higher resolutions and hiding it when space is more limited. See the [SidebarWrapper](https://forge.pnl.gov/standards/#/pnnl-react-core/SidebarWrapper) component for more details on creating a collapsible sidebar.

A Sidebar by itself is pretty much just a column with a border and background color shift. What role it takes is dependent upon the content you put within it. Common patterns used with sidebars are: 

* **Timeline** – See the [Timeline](https://forge.pnl.gov/standards/#/pnnl-react-core/Timeline) and [TimelineItem](https://forge.pnl.gov/standards/#/pnnl-react-core/TimelineItem) pages.
* **Filters and Filter Sets** – When the page includes a set of search or dataset results, it can be useful for the user to filter those results to get closer to what they’re looking for.  To keep the display of the result set clear and visible, a sidebar is often used to store the filters.  The filters can take a variety of forms: a list of checkboxes, date ranges, a typeahead with multiple selection, etc. Those filters can optionally be saved as a collection the user can recall later, which we call a Filter Set.  Examples of applications that use Filters and Filter Sets are [Insight](https://insight.pnl.gov/) and [Information Release](https://inforelease.pnl.gov/).
