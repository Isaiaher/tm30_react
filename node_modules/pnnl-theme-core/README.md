PNNL Theme Core
==============

These are the core theme definitions for PNNL internal websites and applications. 

## How To Use This Theme

Import pnnl-theme-core into your project and use src/less/pnnl-theme-core.less, or reference the compiled CSS files on cdn.pnl.gov.

[https://cdn.pnl.gov/theme_core/pnnl-theme-core.latest.min.css](https://cdn.pnl.gov/theme_core/pnnl-theme-core.latest.min.css) - The latest version of pnnl-theme-core, minified to reduce the file size. This is probably what most projects will want to link to.

https://cdn.pnl.gov/theme_core/pnnl-theme-core.*version*.min.css - A specific version of pnnl-theme-core. Use one of these if you're running into a bug with the latest version and want to temporarily specify an older version for the project.
